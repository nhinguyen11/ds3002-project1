# DS 3002 Project 1

## Data Description
My data of choice came from Kaggle and it has information on Netflix library sizes and pricing plans for a variety of different countries. There are 65 countries in total and for each country, one can learn about the country's Netflix's total library size, total number of TV shows, total number of movies, price for basic plan, price for standard plan, and price for premium plan.
